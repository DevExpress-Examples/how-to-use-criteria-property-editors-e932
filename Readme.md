# How to use Criteria Property Editors


<p>This example illustrates the specifics of using Criteria Property Editors in an XAF application. The complete description is available in the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/CustomDocument3143">How to: Use Criteria Property Editors</a> help topic.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> In this example, the <strong>SessionMixingException</strong> may occur if you refresh a list view filtered by criteria with object references. Several workarounds for this issue are provided in the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T110111">E932 - object belongs to a different session after refresh filter with Business Entity</a> ticket. The issue will be eliminated once the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T110417">CollectionSourceBase - Refresh objects referenced by the applied criteria when the Object Space is reloaded</a> suggestion is implemented.</p>
